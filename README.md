#Setup
Add the data.json file to your solution root folder
Explore the NuGet packages and install NewtonSoftJson
Do some self research and find out how to read in JSON file (hint: JsonConvert.DeserializedOject is part of it)
You will need to break up each section of the JSON file up into different classes, use your resources - ask the TA’s if your stuck. (Maybe find a converter of some sort??)


Output all of the neighborhoods in this data list
Filter out all the neighborhoods that do not have any names
Remove the Duplicates
Rewrite the queries from above, and consolidate all into one single query.
